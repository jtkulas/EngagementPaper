## Definitions of Engagement

The roots of employee [aka work; e.g., @schaufeli_conceptualization_2010] engagement research likely started with theoretical expansions of forms of employee participation [see, for example, @ferris_added_1984] and job involvement [e.g., @elloy_examination_1991]. This exploration extended into broader considerations of attitudes and emotions [@staw_employee_1994] and were informed by further exploration of the dimensionality of constructs such as organizational commitment [@meyer_three-component_1991]. The 1990's saw focused development and refinement [for example, a dissertation; @leone_relation_1995 or actual semantic reference; @kahn_psychological_1990]. @staw_employee_1994 investigated the  relationships between *positive emotions* and favourable work outcomes, and although they do not use the word, "engagement", their distinction between felt and expressed emotion was likely a stimulating influence upon the burgeoning interest in the engagement construct. Gallup is also widely acknowledged as an early pioneer in the measurement of the construct [see, for example, @coffman_hard_1999]. 

+ Personal engagement:Personal engagement is described as the employing or    expressing of oneself physically, cognitively, and emotionally during    work role performances. When engaged, an employee is understood to   be physically involved, cognitively vigilant, and emotionally connected [@kahn_psychological_1990].
+ Engagement/Burnout: Burnout is defined as a psychological syndrome          characterized by           exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy, which is     experienced in response to chronic job         stressors. Engagement is       understood to be the direct opposite of burnout and exist on a                continuum—with engagement on one end and burnout on the other. Exhaustion     (low energy),       cynicism (low involvement), and inefficacy (low           efficacy) are characteristic of burnout;      whereas, high energy, high      involvement, and high efficacy are characteristic of engagement    (Maslach   and Leiter, 1997) [@leiter_areas_2004].
+ Work engagement: Work engagement refers to a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of      mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption. Vigor is characterized by    high levels of energy and mental resilience while working. Dedication refers to being         strongly involved in one’s work and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm,         inspiration, pride, and challenge. Absorption is characterized by being fully concentrated    and happily engrossed in one’s work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties     with detaching oneself from work [@schaufeli_measurement_2002] - The Utrecht Work Engagement       Scale (UWES), a self-report questionnaire first developed by Schaufeli and Bakker (2003)   [@schaufeli_uwesutrecht_2003]   includes the three aspects of work engagement: vigor, dedication, and absorption. - we have   to make note of how we are different from this! 
+ Employee engagement:  Employee engagement refers to the ‘‘individual’s involvement and        satisfaction as well as enthusiasm for work’’ [@harter_business-unit-level_2002]
  Work engagement is the mental state where employees...  


+ ...feel full with physical energy (**Vigor**)
+ ...are enthusiastic about the content of their work and the things they do (**Dedication**)
+ ...are so immersed in their work activities that time seems to fly (**Absorption**)

The tripartite substantive model of employee engagement is also partially informed by the definitions provided with the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale [@schaufeli_utrecht_2003].
