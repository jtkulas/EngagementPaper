abstract: |
  Employee engagement has, in recent years, enjoyed a surge in popularity as a positive employee outcome.
  Despite this burgeoning interest, disagreement still remains regarding its factor structure and nomological relationship with similar concepts, such as burnout.
  The classical definition of engagement divides it between the dimensions of vigor, dedication, and absorption, while the tripartite model of attitudes divides engagement between its cognitive, behavioral, and affective manifestations. 
  Using bifactor analysis, study 1 proposes a scale that reconciles these two models.
  Study 2 convergently and discriminantly validates this scale.

Recent decades have seen a proliferation of interest and research in the construct of employee engagement.



> more on why we're looking at tripartite model

The roots of employee [aka work; e.g., @schaufeli_conceptualization_2010] engagement research likely started with theoretical expansions of forms of employee participation [see, for example, @ferris_added_1984] and job involvement [e.g., @elloy_examination_1991]. This exploration extended into broader considerations of attitudes and emotions [@staw_employee_1994] and were informed by further exploration of the dimensionality of constructs such as organizational commitment [@meyer_three-component_1991]. The 1990's saw focused development and refinement (for example, a dissertation; @leone_relation_1995 or actual semantic reference; @kahn_psychological_1990). @staw_employee_1994 investigated the relationships between *positive emotions* and favorable work outcomes, and although they do not use the word, "engagement", their distinction between felt and expressed emotion likely held influence upon the burgeoning interest in the engagement construct.

## Response cues in Psychological assessment

Response cues in general and order effects in particular have their root in Cognitive Psychology, with much of the work occuring in the early days of Cognitive Psychology (e.g., the 1960's on). Primacy and recency (whether an item is presented at the beginning or end of a list) are known to elicit differences in response [e.g., @krosnick1987evaluation]. This effect has also been noted in methodological contexts in the form of differential carryover effects. For example, the order of presentation of samples in a product taste test [see, for example, @dean1980presentation]. @ackerman1989comparison found only small differences in response patterns when presenting *test* items in a fixed versus random ordering. @mashburn2014effect experimentally controlled the presentation of rated material, finding higher indices of reliability and validity of ratings when content was administered randomly (e.g., order effects were controlled for).

@knowles1988item and @hamilton1990self both administered exhaustively crossed orderings of items, noting better item discrimination (e.g., corrected item-total correlations) *later* in the assessment, regardless of actual item content. @steinberg1994context provides a description of this effect: "...literature converges on the view that responding repeatedly to items representing a single, unidimensional psychological construct increases the accessibility of relevant beliefs or feelings, which in turn, increases the relation between the item resopnse and the underlying construct." (p. 341) This statement could be rephrased as: location serves as a response cue. "This attentional focus influences item responses through such processes as item interpretation and ease of retrieval of relevant feelings that are applied to the item" [@steinberg1994context, p. 341]. 

@steinberg1994context looked at order effects in personality measurement, 

>Weinberg, M. K., Seton, C., & Cameron, N. (2018). The Measurement of Subjective Wellbeing: Item-Order Effects in the Personal Wellbeing Index—Adult. Journal of Happiness Studies, 19(1), 315–332. https://doi-org.ezproxy.montclair.edu/10.1007/s10902-016-9822-1

@Weinberg2018 examine the effects of randomized items and domains in the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI) in measure subjective wellbeing (SWB). @Weinberg2018 conduct two studies one, looking at the PWI comparing its usual general-specific format to a modified format, furthermore, the order of the domain items will stay the same, while the general items will be random in question order. In the second study, @Weinberg2018 randomized the domain items while the general items will be the same to standard scale order. In @Weinberg2018, study 1 showed no results between general specific format and the modified format, however in study 2, they did find that presenting the random order effects did have lower means, then fixed order effects. @Weinberg2018 present many different reasons for this outcomes, which could be those in the random order effect group had more participant experiencing high levels of wellbeing, and the other explanation is that changing order of items of PWI could affect the score. @Weinberg2018 conducted a multiple regression analysis which showed that random order group account for 9% more variance in GLS than the fixed order group and conducted a confirmatory factor analysis showing that the fixed order groups was not a good model fit. 

@serico2021 looked at item order effects in self-report measures of aggression perpetration and victimization. @serico2021 provides a descriptions of two general biases in self-report measures, which are the subject's biases, and bias in wording, order, or format of items in the measure. In previous studies, there was an item order effect and item group effect in the measure that shows participants' response and psychometric properties of an aggression measure. # citation from other articles (Dietz & Jasinski, 2007; Shorey, Woods, & Cornelius, 2016). ######### In @serico2021, the findings shows that there is an item order affect in the reported frequency of aggression perpetration. It shows that item order can influence a person self-report in aggression perpetration and victimization, showing that there are methodological issue that have to be consider when developing and utilizing measure of aggression and victimization. This methodological issues can still be applicable to other measure such as workplace engagement, since we also look at people's behaviors, cognitive, and emotions.






Although occasionally referred to as residing on the opposing pole to *burnout* [@maslach_early_2008], these two constructs are currently most commonly conceptualized as being distinct [@timms2012burnt; @kim_burnout_2009; @goering2017not; @schaufeli2008workaholism], although certainly not universally [@cole2012job; @taris2017burnout]. Comparing the two, @goering2017not concluded that they have a moderate (negative) association, but also distinct nomological networks. @schaufeli2008workaholism investigated both internal and external association indicators, concluding that engagement and burnout (as well as *workaholism*) should be considered three distinct constructs. 

Burnout can be defined as a psychological syndrome characterized by exhaustion (low energy), cynicism (low involvement), and inefficacy (low self-efficacy), which is experienced in response to chronic job stressors [e.g., @leiter_areas_2004; @maslach1997causes]. Alternatively, engagement refers to an individual worker's involvement and satisfaction as well as enthusiasm for work [@harter_business-unit-level_2002]. @schaufeli_uwesutrecht_2003 further specify a "positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption" (p. 74). Via their conceptualization, vigor is described as high levels of energy and mental resilience while working. Dedication refers to being strongly involved in one's work and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge. Absorption is characterized by being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in one's work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work [@schaufeli_measurement_2002]. The dimension of absorption has been noted as being influenced in conceptual specification by [@csikszentmihalyi1990flow]'s concept of "flow".

Regarding measurement, Gallup is widely acknowledged as an early pioneer in the measurement of the construct [see, for example, @coffman_hard_1999]. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) is another self-report questionnaire developed by @schaufeli_uwesutrecht_2003 that directly assesses the vigor, dedication, and absorption elements.

> TRIPARTITE MODEL--work here

The first, to our knowledge, use of the word "engagement" as a construct came in @kahn1990psychological, defining it as: "the harnessing of organization members' selves to their work roles; in engagement, people employ and express themselves physically, cognitively, and emotionally during role performances." Although this definition was quickly bypassed by subsequent papers (see, for example, [@baumruk2004missing] and [@shaw2005engagement], who framed it in terms of one's cognitive and affective *commitment* to one's organization), @kahn1990psychological's definition is notable in that it conforms to the then-ascendant tripartite model of attitudes proposed by @rosenberg_cognitive_1960. This model frames attitudes as latent variables that manifest cognitively, affectively and behaviorally.

Although falling out of favor in the decades following its construction, interest in the tripartite model was revived by @kaiser_campbell_2019,

> we need to do some market research on the Q12: 1. what's the feedback report look like? (google images show one overall "satsifaction" score and/or one overall "engagement" score), 2. how much does it cost, 3. what are the 200 pulse items Gallup refers to? (6/7/21)

Our conceptualization of work engagement is a mental state wherein employees...

-   ...feel energized (**Vigor**)
-   ...are enthusiastic about the content of their work and the things they do (**Dedication**)
-   ...are so immersed in their work activities that time seems compressed (**Absorption**)

This model is not without criticism, however. Some critics question its structural validity by pointing out that vigor, dedication and absorption all correlate highly with each other [@kulikowski2017we].

The present article explores two methods for constructing a scale that incorporates both the substantive and attitudinal models into one, a more classical one based on corrected item-total correlations and one based on modification indices.

## Participants

`r num` individuals provided ratings across 36 candidate items. These participants were gathered via snowball sampling, with an initial population of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as professional acquaintances of faculty members.

## Material

Our survey was administered on Qualtrics.

  

## Procedure
### Item-Order Effects

In our survey, we randomized our 36 items for our engagement measures, to control for item-order effects. We created four conditions: 1) grouping items by substantive then attitudinal, 2) grouping items by attitudinal then substantive, 3) grouping items by substantive then a control randomization of the attitudinal items, and 4) grouping items by attitudinal, and then control randomization of the substantive items.




### CFA Modification Indices

We followed two parallel stepwise item-reduction processes centered around eliminating items in decreasing order of modification indices. Looking at the 36-item substantive and attitudinal models independently, we requested modification indices from each, with the intent of retaining indicators whose fixed shared residual covariances were associated with high modification indices (indicating better model fit if the paths were freed). The item pair with the highest modification index was scrutinized, with a subjective group judgment made on wording/semantics content domain coverage. The less preferred item was removed from the model. In cases where the highest modification index was between the only two remaining items in a substantive-attitudinal pair, these items were passed over for scrutiny in favor of the items with the next-highest index. This process was repeated until 18 items remained (i.e., 2 items for each of the 9 substantive-attitudinal pairs)

For example, the path with the highest modification index across both CFAs was between item 2 and item 4, which are both indicators of "Absorption" and "Cognition". One of these items was therefore a candidate for deletion, and semantic preference was given to item 4, "I find it difficult to mentally disconnect from work" over item 2. After item 2 was excluded from both scale definitions (substantive and attitudinal), the CFAs were re-run and modification indices re-checked for bi-factor structure optimizing modifications.[^2]

[^2]: Probably put a table in here highlighting certain modification indices (with a key to intended factor-item association). Look at "modincides1"

The end result was two separate final scale definitions (one optimized for the substantive model and one for the attitudinal).

We prioritized item deletions such that an item was implicated for deletion if: 1) modification index was high (relative to others) and 2) error residual was within same "cell". The choice of item to delete was based on author preference for wording/semantics as well as construct element coverage (considering the possible consequences for construct deficiency). Item variance was also consulted (retention more likely with greater item variance).


### Single factor versus bifactor approaches

We conducted correct-item total correlations using

## Data analysis

We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.

# Results

CFA drafts below

## Study 2

Construct validation was acccomplished via administration of the 17-item UWES as well as the @saks2006antecedents 12-item scale. @saks2006antecedents aggregates to two scales: job and organizational engagement.
