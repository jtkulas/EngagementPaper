# Future plans 

![](future.jpg)

Most effort is currently dedicated to the technical report. We also need feedback reports and a user manual. The feedback report(s) are the most secondarily important.

The development of the feedback report will occur in stages:

1. static .pdf
2. "static" .html (standard template but potentially interactive elements)
3. "static" `xaringan` [@R-xaringan]
4. dynamic `xaringan`
  + user-generated presenter notes
  + user-selected visuals (taken from .html report)
5. Dynamic dashboard

The intent is to lean on the `xaringan` presentation as the central marketable piece. Initial templates should be able to do client colors and fonts via chunk specification, but evolved templates should be client-driven, such that figures can be selected and annotated from the .html, generating a user-selected and annotated `xaringan` presentation that can be hosted by Eagle but accessed via password protection by the client.

Eventually Eagle could optimize interpretation via contributions of cognitive psychologists, graphic designers, etc.

## Things to do 

+ Finalize items 
+ ~~Get survey into Qualtrics for pilot testing~~
+ Work on feedback report 
+ Generate User Manual

Three projects are being targetted for SIOP 2022: 

1. Engagement instrument development
2. Measurement invariance across the 4 pilot administration conditions
3. Engagement instrument validation (data collection summer 2021)
