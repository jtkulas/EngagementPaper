"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 Definitions of Engagement", " 1 Introduction 1.1 Definitions of Engagement The roots of employee (aka work; e.g., W. Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2010) engagement research likely started with theoretical expansions of forms of employee participation (see, for example, Ferris &amp; Hellier, 1984) and job involvement (e.g., Elloy et al., 1991). This exploration extended into broader considerations of attitudes and emotions (Staw et al., 1994) and were informed by further exploration of the dimensionality of constructs such as organizational commitment (Meyer &amp; Allen, 1991). The 1990s saw focused development and refinement (for example, a dissertation; Leone (1995) or actual semantic reference; Kahn (1990)). Staw et al. (1994) investigated the relationships between positive emotions and favourable work outcomes, and although they do not use the word, engagement, their distinction between felt and expressed emotion was likely a stimulating influence upon the burgeoning interest in the engagement construct. Gallup is also widely acknowledged as an early pioneer in the measurement of the construct (see, for example, Coffman &amp; Harter, 1999). Kahn (1990) described engaged employees as being physically involved, cognitively vigilant, and emotionally connected. Although occasionally referred to as residing on the opposing pole to burnout (Christina Maslach &amp; Leiter, 2008), these two constructs are currently most commonly conceptualized as being distinct (Timms et al., 2012), although not universally (Cole et al., 2012; Taris et al., 2017). Engagement/Burnout: Burnout is defined as a psychological syndrome characterized by exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy, which is experienced in response to chronic job stressors. Engagement is understood to be the direct opposite of burnout and exist on a continuumwith engagement on one end and burnout on the other. Exhaustion (low energy), cynicism (low involvement), and inefficacy (low efficacy) are characteristic of burnout; whereas, high energy, high involvement, and high efficacy are characteristic of engagement C. Maslach &amp; Leiter (1997) (Maslach and Leiter, 1997) (Leiter &amp; Maslach, 2004). Work engagement: Work engagement refers to a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption. Vigor is characterized by high levels of energy and mental resilience while working. Dedication refers to being strongly involved in ones work and experiencing a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge. Absorption is characterized by being fully concentrated and happily engrossed in ones work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work (Wilmar B. Schaufeli et al., 2002) - The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), a self-report questionnaire first developed by Schaufeli and Bakker (2003) (W. B. Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2003) includes the three aspects of work engagement: vigor, dedication, and absorption. - we have to make note of how we are different from this! Employee engagement: Employee engagement refers to the individuals involvement and satisfaction as well as enthusiasm for work (James K. Harter et al., 2002) Work engagement is the mental state where employees feel full with physical energy (Vigor) are enthusiastic about the content of their work and the things they do (Dedication) are so immersed in their work activities that time seems to fly (Absorption) The tripartite substantive model of employee engagement is also partially informed by the definitions provided with the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (Wilmar B. Schaufeli &amp; Bakker, 2003). "],["instrument-creation.html", "2 Instrument creation 2.1 Intended Structure 2.2 Item generation 2.3 Content Validation", " 2 Instrument creation 2.1 Intended Structure At some point we decided to attempt an a priori bi-factor structure, whereby each of the substantive dimensions (Dedication, Vigor, and Absorption)1 could further be deconstructed into the attitudinal elements of Cognition, Affect, and Behavior (see, for example, Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993; Rosenberg, 1960). Through item-writing and revision, it began to dawn on us that the substantive elements may already reflect the Cognition (Vigor), Affect (Absorption), and Behavioral (Dedication) dimensions. As of August, 2020, however, we could not locate a source article that made this potential confound explicit, so we persisted through crafting items that reflected cognitive, affective, and behavioral indicators of each substantive dimension.2 The most relevant acknowledgement of this potential confound was made by Wilmar B. Schaufeli et al. (2002) (pp. 74-75): Hence, engagement is defined as a positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption. Rather than a momentary and specific state, engagement refers to a more persistent and pervasive affective cognitive state that is not focused on any particular object, event, individual, or behavior. Vigor is characterized by high levels of energy and mental resilience while working, the willingness to invest effort in ones work, and persistence even in the face of difficulties. Dedication is characterized by a sense of significance, enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge. Instead of involvement we prefer to use the term dedication. Although, involvement  like dedication (see above)  is usually defined in terms of psychological identification with ones work or ones job (Kanungo, 1982; Lawler and Hall, 1970), whereby the latter goes one step beyond, both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In a qualitative sense, dedication refers to a particularly strong involvement that goes one step further than the usual level of identification. In a qualitative sense, dedication has a wider scope by not only referring to a particular cognitive or belief state but including the affective dimension as well. The final dimension of engagement, absorption, is characterized by being fully concentrated and deeply engrossed in ones work, whereby time passes quickly and one has difficulties with detaching oneself from work. The survey is intentionally complex in terms of item and scale associations. There are three substantive engagement dimensions as well as three attitudinal dimensions, and item cross-loadings are intended to fully exhaust the 3 x 3 conditions (e.g., each item loads on one substantive and one attitudinal dimension): Substantive Attitudinal Dedication Affective Absorption Behavioral Vigor Cognitive The feedback report uses the terms, feel, do, and think instead of the Psychological literature-based affect, behavior, and cognition. 2.2 Item generation After content validation but prior to settling on 4 candidate items per 3x3 condition, there was a dearth of items within some of the Affective, Cognitive, or Behavioral item groupings. We generated additional candidates at this point and have these items located here (Montclair State University e-mail needed to access). It was from this larger list of (reduced) candidate items that the 36 pilot candidates were identified (and in some cases modified, edited, or otherwise further crafted) 2.3 Content Validation 7 Eagle I.O consultants were twice instructed to place each of 34 items into one of three categories: Absorption, Dedication, or Vigor, and Cognitive, Affective, or Behavioral. Instructions asked each rater to: INSTRUCTIONS: Place an X in the column that you feel is the best fit for each item (only one X per row please) The substantive scale definitions provided for ratings were: Absorption: Being fully immersed in ones work, where time passes quickly and one has difficulty detaching from work tasks Vigor: Experiencing persistent levels of energy, effort, and enthusiasm while working Dedication: Experiencing pride and challenge in ones work, as well as strong feelings of support from and loyalty toward the organization The attitudinal scale definitions were: Cognitive: Pertaining to thoughts or general mental processes (for example what someone thinks) Affective: Pertaining to feelings or emotions (for example, how someone feels) Behavioral: Pertaining to acts or actions (for example, what someone does) The goal was to identify item(s) that were equally and heavily implicated with one substantive and one attitudinal scale. We also discovered at this point that some contagious agent has infiltrated the minds of people working on this project, such that the word, absorption confounds our spelling abilities, and roughly 50% of the time ends up being spelled (misspelled?), absorbtion We did, however, find some criticisms of the tripartite model of attitudes as originally specified by Rosenberg (1960), although there has also been a recent attempt to reintroduce and improve upon the original model (Kaiser &amp; Wilson, 2019) as well as repurposing of the framework as a process [e.g., thoughts and feelings leading to behavior; Pachankis (2007)]. "],["procedure.html", "3 Procedure 3.1 Pilot 3.2 Demographic Information", " 3 Procedure 3.1 Pilot The pilot administrations consisted of 36 items that were presented in one of four administration groupings (see Appendix B): 1) within substantive dimension (attitudinally grouped [but randomized within blocks of 4]), 2) within attitudinal dimension (substantively grouped [but randomized within blocks of 4]), 3) within substantive dimension (randomly distributed by attitude), and 4) within attitudinal dimension (randomly presented by substance).3 The four experimental conditions therefore prioritized and reflected the 3x3 groupings or one of the organization schemes (cognitive, affective, and behavioral or dedication, absorption, and vigor). We chose to control the order of item administration because of our a priori specification of a bi-factor structure, with the expectation that item ordering would serve as a response cue, yielding stronger factor structural support based on the organization scheme. 3.1.1 Sampling strategy (pilot) The pilot sampling strategy consisted of snowball (aka referral) sampling as well as questionnaire posting within social media platforms (LinkedIn and facebook). The pilot goal was to reduce the final instrument from 36 candidate items (4 per cell) to 18 retained items (2 per cell). We hoped to obtain about 250 total responses viable for analysis. The launch was informed by research looking at different days of the week and their effectiveness regarding response rate. This was both commercial as well as academic (e.g., Anseel et al., 2010). Eagle I.O members sent a template email asking working adults to take the survey and forward it to family and friends who also qualify as participants. Eagle I.O members were also tasked with reaching out to other students, alumni, friends, and family through the following: Facebook post on MSU I/O group page LinkedIn profiles of all Eagle I.O members Email first and second year students directly Email MSU alumni directly Email I/O professors Mentors reached out to mentees individually Survey was posted on the Eagle I.O webpage 3.1.1.1 Pilot analyses A Confirmatory Bi-Factor Analysis will be performed to determine the best candidate items for the final assessment. 3.2 Demographic Information These are to be included in future administrations in an attempt to develop marketable norms: Employees who work overtime vs. those who do not Employees who get paid for overtime vs. those who dont receive compensation for extra hours worked4 Decision was made on 10/13 to have the order of presentation randomized within each of the broader organization blocks (for example, Condition 3: all Affective, Cognitive, and Behavioral Absorption items were randomly administered, then all ABC Dedication items, etc [although DAC was also randomized by block such that not every respondent had the same DAC ordering]) I was thinking about this because at my job I have been working 12+ hours some days yet I do not get overtime pay. Not sure if this would work for what we are doing and I know my work experiences are not universal (nor should they be) haha! "],["analyses.html", "4 Analyses 4.1 Pilot analyses 4.2 Construct and Criterion-related Validation", " 4 Analyses 4.1 Pilot analyses 282 people responded. We may want to further screen these 282 responses for short response durations. According to communications with Qualtrics in early December, this is the number of seconds to complete the entire survey. Currently, the number of people who clicked on the assessment link (330) versus valid n (282) may take care of our very low duration respondents. The shortest response duration in the 330 datafile is 101 whereas the lowest in the 282 datafile is 43. All analyses were performed via R version R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) (R Core Team, 2021). 4.1.1 Classical test theory In addition to the below interactive plot [via plotly version 4.9.3; Sievert et al.

Condition 2 administered items within the attitudinal dimensions (with successive randomized blocks of Absorption, Vigor, and Dedication items). Condition 3 stressed the substantive dimensions (with items fully randomized regardless of attitudinal association). Condition 4 stressed the attitudinal dimensions (with items fully randomized within attitudinal dimension regardless of substantive scale association, see Chapter 3.1 and Appendix B). All internal consistency estimates were generated via psych version 2.1.3 (Revelle, 2021).

This definition was created by Eagle IO Spring 2019, and modified by Kulas and Renata the following Fall semester of 2019 to include the four dimensions of Fulfillment, Absorbtion, Dedication, and Vigor. A.2 Spring 2020 We considered removing fulfillment. Fulfillment: finding meaning in ones work, while having a sense of autonomy, growth, usefulness, achievement, and feeling appreciated by org. [Satisfaction(?)] It was decided to operationalize fullfillment as an outcome of engagement rather than a definitional element A.2.1 February 4, 2020 We lost the document where we had saved the citations for the creation of our engagement dimensions. we found it today (02/04/2020). Three out of the four dimensions (Dedication, Vigor, and Absorbtion) came from Wilmar B. Schaufeli et al. (2002), and we are trying to find where Fulfillment came from. We are also trying to improve the definition of each domain by looking at the current items and conducting a Modified Q sort (not correct name) to create piles of items that have commonalities within each domain. A.2.2 February 24, 2020 Definitional amendment notes and considerations: Absorption: being fully concentrated and happily immersed in ones work [time passes quickly and has difficulty detaching from ones work; Wilmar B. Schaufeli et al. (2002)] Dedication/Commitment: being strongly involved in ones work and experiencing a sense of enthusiasm, inspiration, pride, and challenge. (Wilmar B. Schaufeli et al., 2002) Identifying as an organizational member/ambassador This includes conceptual elements of identification with the organization, a sense of oneness, seeking continuous learning and improvement. We got rid of challenge altogether and moved the inspiration and pride elements to other categories. Dedication: seeking continous imporvement and demonstrating initiative Vigor: investing consistent effort, persistence, energy, and mental resilience while working (Wilmar B. Schaufeli et al., 2002) maybe add enthusiasm here as well Vigor: Experiencing persistent levels of energy and enthusiasm while working A.2.3 Structural considerations It was considered to potentially change from a focus on affective, cognitive, and behavioral to whether their engagement stems from content/satisfaction with the organization or the people they work with. This idea was however abandoned Spring 2020. After completing individual Q-sorts (Kulas and Renata) we decided to revisit the originally specified substantive definitions and build them up a little to make the difference between them more noticeable (and we also retained the affect, behavior, cognition focus). A.3 Summer 2020 Definitions as of 5/19/2020: Absorption: Being fully immersed in ones work, where time passes quickly and one has difficulty detaching from work tasks Vigor: Experiencing persistent levels of energy, effort, and enthusiasm while working Dedication: Experiencing pride and challenge in ones work, as well as strong feelings of support from and loyalty toward the organization The development team content validation as well as the broader content validation to inform the pilot administration (see Chapter 2.3) retained these definitions we ordered all the items according to the ones we individually selected for each category and created an item bank with the remaining items.

Two indices were investigated: Flesch-Kincaid is the same grade level index thats currently used by Microsoft Word (Kincaid et al., 1975) whereas Dale.Chall reflects Nwd [difficulty of words; Chall &amp; Dale (1995)]. These indices are primarily influenced by two qualitative characteristics: Nwf, which is the number of words matching the Dale-Chall List of 3000 familiar words, and Nwd, which is the number of difficult words not matching the Dale-Chall list of familiar words. The average Flesch-Kincaied (e.g., reading grade) was 6.2 (sd = 3.04). The average Dale-Chall index was 38.61 (sd = 11.11).
